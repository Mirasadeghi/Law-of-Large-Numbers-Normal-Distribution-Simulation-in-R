🎯 Simulating the Law of Large Numbers with R

This project demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers** using the standard normal distribution in **R**.

I simulate random values and check what proportion of them fall between **-1 and 1**. According to the **68–95–99.7 rule**, about **68.2%** of values in a standard normal distribution should fall within this interval.

## 📊 What This Project Does

- Generates `N` random values from the standard normal distribution  
- Counts how many values lie between `-1` and `1`  
- Calculates the proportion and compares it to the theoretical 68.2%  
- Visualizes the distribution using:
  - Density plot with shaded region between -1 and 1
  - Histogram with highlighted range
  - Bar plot comparing theoretical and simulated values

## 🧠 Why It Matters

This is a practical demonstration of how the **Law of Large Numbers** works:
> The larger the sample size, the closer the result gets to the expected theoretical value.

It's also a great way to practice working with:
- Loops and conditionals in R
- Basic data visualization
- Statistical thinking using simulation


## 📸 Sample Output

You can expect an output like:
Simulated Proportion: 0.6823
Which closely matches the theoretical value of `0.682`.

## 🚀 Run it Yourself

You can run the script using any R environment (e.g., RStudio).
Feel free to modify the value of N to see how results vary with smaller or larger sample sizes.
